        One of the resources we want to offer to club members is the opportunity to make meaningful connections with those that can help them make significant decisions about their academic and professional futures. For this purpose we've established a volunteer
        mentoring program. It is a simple, informal experience to help students get a head on their futures through practical advice from their peers.
